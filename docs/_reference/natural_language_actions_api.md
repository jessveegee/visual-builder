# Natural Language Actions API

Zapier’s [Natural Language Actions (NLA) API](https://nla.zapier.com/docs/) is an AI alpha product designed to work with natural language-based products. It leverages the Zapier platform, with over [6000 apps](https://zapier.com/apps). You can include the capabilities of Zapier’s platform in your own product.

With the Natural Language Actions API, you can:
* Access Zapier’s platform of 6000+ apps within your own product.
* Integrate with chatbots or [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Large_language_models).
