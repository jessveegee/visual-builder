# Adding Support for Transfer

> **Note**: As of 1st April 2023, we no longer accept reviews for new Transfer source apps. We’re currently evaluating our process for building new sources for Transfer. During this period we aren’t accepting new Transfer sources built by partners for review. We don't have an expected timeframe of when we're opening reviews for new Transfer source apps.

## What is Transfer?

[Transfer](https://transfer.zapier.com/) is a Zapier service that enables users to perform bulk operations using their historical data. Today Zaps only process new data and events created after the user turns on their Zap. Transfer lets users reach back and use existing data. Think of it as allowing your users to leverage Zapier for ETL (“Extract, Transform, Load”) tasks.

Some example usage scenarios:

- A user has new email campaign software and they want to load all the leads from their CRM into it.
- A user ran a survey, but didn't build a Zap ahead of time to move those responses to their email marketing tool. They can use Transfer to reach back and pull those responses into their software of choice.
- A user wants to choose specific leads that previously ran through a Zap, and send them to a different tool.
- A user has a one-off data migration where the source has a paginated API endpoint and the destination has a Zapier integration.
