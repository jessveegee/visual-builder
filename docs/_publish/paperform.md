"There is no way we can make a direct integration for every new or existing service that our users might want to use. Zapier makes it effortless for us to provide that value to our users." - Dean McPherson, [Paperform](https://paperform.co/) Co-Founder and CTO

## Integration outcomes

Since the release of its [Partner API](https://platform.zapier.com/embed/zap-editor#example-implementation)-powered [integration library](https://paperform.co/integrations/), Paperform sees:

- Higher retention rates for users with a Zap
- Higher lifetime value (LTV) for users with a Zap
- Reduced developer time on integrations

### Higher retention rates for users with a Zap

Less than a year after Paperform's public launch, Dean McPherson and his co-founder, Diony McPherson, prioritized developer time to embedding Zapier in their product.

*"Integrations are an integral—no pun intended—part of our business,"* McPherson says. And for Paperform, the importance of integrations carries over to their customers' businesses. *"We find customers who connect to Zapier are closely aligned to our product, and therefore more likely to subscribe, be happy with Paperform, stay for a long time, and integrate Paperform with more and more of their systems."*

### Higher lifetime value (LTV) for users with a Zap

With user retention up, so too follows the revenue generated from users of Paperform Zaps.

"By being less likely to churn, a user who is connected to Zapier will statistically stay around longer, and as a result, pay more," McPherson says. "A user who is connected to Zapier will statistically stay around longer, and as a result, pay more."

### Reduced developer time on integrations

It's hard to imagine a tool like Paperform without a large library of integrations—forms are a horizontal product with countless use cases.

"Zapier has enabled us to bring our service to market without getting buried in the technical details of managing hundreds of direct integrations," McPherson says.

Since supporting Zapier—the first of any third-party integration—Paperform has added direct integrations, too. This hasn't reduced the Zapier integration value one bit though. "The few direct integrations we do support cost us a lot in development, maintenance and support. If we were to try and provide all these integrations ourselves, we'd be facing an impossible task."
